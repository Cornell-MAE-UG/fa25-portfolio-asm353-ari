Our project focused on the dissection and engineering analysis of a multifunction massage gun, selected for its interesting mechanical components and therapeutic applications. The device included three interchangeable massage heads, a foam ball, a three-pronged textured plastic head, and a flat metal attachment—allowing users to customize the type of mechanical stimulation. Using a slow-motion camera, we observed that the heads move in a circular, sinusoidal pattern rather than simple linear oscillation. The user interface consists of a single multifunction button that adjusts motor speed between 1800 and 3600 rpm, with the motor driving an off-center rotating disk that converts rotational motion into the reciprocating vibrations felt by the user. Internal supports stabilize the system, ensuring proper alignment and reducing unwanted vibration. We modeled the massage gun as a spring-mass-damper system, derived its block diagram, transfer function, and corresponding ODE, and then used MATLAB to simulate its behavior. Using the measured period (0.0333 s), peak-to-peak amplitude (5 mm), and estimated input force (47.88 N), we calculated the effective mass and stiffness of the system. With all of this, we were able to plot the expected results in MATLAB. Overall, this analysis provided insight into the mechanical design, dynamic behavior, and potential for modeling and simulating therapeutic massage devices.
