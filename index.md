## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University's Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, with a strong focus on the aerospace, defense, and automotive sectors. Currently, I am studying towards completing my bachelor's and master's in engineering by Spring 2027. I am an engineer on Cornell Racing (FSAE) as part of the Unsprung Team, where we’re designing an electric race car. I am working on creating the team's dynamometer testing system. Additionally, I worked as an engineering design intern at General Motors, where I helped develop parts for future vehicles. Previously, I served as a Magnetics Engineer for Cornell Hyperloop and a mechanical design researcher at the Energy and Environment Research Laboratory.
